**Objective:**
State the purpose of the feature. Add any information you feel is pertinent to understanding the issue such as references to past issues, links, images, etc.

**TODO:**
Include which `directory/file` the feature should be located in. Then give a sequence of _n_ steps in list form: 

- Step 1: Do stuff.
- Step _n_: Do more stuff,

The **TODO** section can also have _tasks_. These essentially break apart the main issue into "mini-issues". Tasks should have their own pull requests and should be completed in the order listed.

**Task 1: (Complete)**
- Step 1: This is the first step of task 1.
- Step _n_: This is the final step of task 1.

**Task 2: (Incomplete)**
- Step 1: This is the first step of task 2.
- Step _n_: This is the final step of task 2.

**Testing:**
Provide test cases for the feature. Think of ways to demonstrate that the feature is working and include suggestions for any potential assignees. If you broke the issue down into tasks, be sure to consider that here.

**Optional NOTE/Resources:**
Here you can provide resources that could be helpful to completing the issue or anything that doesn't fall under any of the above categories .

**EDIT:** If there are any significant changes made to the issue itself, make the changes and document them at the very bottom of the issue.
