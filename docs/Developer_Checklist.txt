Guide to approving pull requests

Request changes at any step

Check to see if...
1. ...the PR is addressing more than one issue (it shouldn't)
2. ...the request is merging a repository branch to dev.
3. ...there are any merge conflicts detected (branch is possibly not up to date with dev)
4. ...the appropriate files are being modified/added (no .pyc files or files unrelated to
        the issue should be included in the request)
5. ...all the tests in the test directory pass. (run master test file)
6. ...the changes achieve what the corresponding issue is describing.
7. ...all changes have documentation if needed (functions should be in Sphinx ReST format)
8. ...all naming conventions (PEP8) have been followed.
