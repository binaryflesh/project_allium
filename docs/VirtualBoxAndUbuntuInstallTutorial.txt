This is a tutorial for installing Ubuntu for network-related testing

First download VirtualBox and install

https://www.virtualbox.org/

Click the large blue download box

Select your OS under VirtualBox 5.2.22 Platform packages.

Save the file and when the file is downloaded, double click the download to install

During installation, all you have to do is click next and yes. If you are prompted to install new oracle software, click yes. Click finish when the application has finished installing.

After installing VirtualBox, download Ubuntu

The page will list Download Ubuntu Desktop

Click the green download button under Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

Save the file to you machine and the download will begin

The file is large (1.8 GB) and will take time to download

When Ubuntu has been downloaded, open VirtualBox and navigate to new

Name the virtual machine whatever you want, choose from the drop-down menu

Chose VDI and click next

Click next at storage on physical hard disk
